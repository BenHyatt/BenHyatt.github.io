    <p class="lead">The Greater Organization for Leadership in Democracy was founded by Deniz A. Erdal and Ben H. Underwood in January 2019 as the only political party within Upper Arlington High School. With the goal of promoting student leadership, the party nominates candidates to run in class elections. The party now counts nearly 100 students as members. In December of 2019 the party launched a fundraising raffle to raise money for a non-profit.

    <p class="lead">There are now two spinoff "parties": the Super Gold Party and the Super Super Gold Party. While the ELT of the GOLD Party sees imitation as the highest form of flattery, the GOLD Party does not see these copy cats as veritable parties, as neither has bylaws, a governing structure, or any approval from the school.</p>
