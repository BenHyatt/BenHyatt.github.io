        <p>The GOLD Party is working to gather data and information regarding the efficacy of School Resource Officers in Upper Arlington. This is not only in response to the harrowing murder of George Floyd, but also in response to the many instances of police officers attacking, gassing, tazing, arresting, and shooting innocent civilians and members of the press. To do this, we are taking advantage of Ohio Revised Code 149.43, which gives us, as citizens, the right to inspect documents from public institutions; this effort will culminate in an executive summary which will include a policy recommendation. Data will also be gathered on comparable area school districts, and we will do a comparative analysis. We are also seeking out the voices of students and community stakeholders. Suggestions should be sent to the Executive Leadership Team (ELT@UAGOLDParty.org).</p>
